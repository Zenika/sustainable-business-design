# sustainable-business-design
This non-dev project is a tool box for the teams wanting to design and develop sustainable digital services.

As the digital world is exponentially growing and its environmental impact is now more visible and shared, we thought it was time to address the environmental impact behind our daily work.
As the digital world is changing with new technilogy which are challenging the social world, we thought is was time to address all the social impact behind our design choices.

We already have many practices that address some large aspect of sustainable design but as team members we don't always link them to it. This is the main objectif of this tool box.
So we've created cards that link usual non-technical habits, tools, workshop formats to the subject of sustainability in IT design and development. 
Each card is organized as follow:
  Card name
    Title
    Category
    Objective
    Intro
    Content
    Tips

The cards are grouped according to 5 themes: 
* Understanding responsible digital technology;
* Making it accessible to all;
* Improving functionality;
* Working on content; 
* Converging practices.
